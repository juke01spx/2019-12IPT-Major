			<p>The character that the player controls in the game of Hollow Knight.</p>
			
			<p>The Knight is a Vessel born to the higher beings, the Pale King and the White Lady, with Void inside their shell. Vessels are stated to be the progeny and spawn of the King and Queen of Hallownest; beginning their lives born from eggs which are found in an area of The Abyss known as Birthplace.</p>
			
			<p>Through all references and events in-game, the Knight is never once referred to with a gender which is deliberate as Vessels are genderless beings. This fact is made more clear by Hornet being called "The Gendered Child" by both the White Lady and the Midwife; leaving her to be the only progeny of the Pale King to have a gender.</p>
			
			<p>In the Birthplace cutscene, it is shown that the Knight fell back into the Abyss after it was sealed. Yet at the start of the game, they can be seen wandering around the Howling Cliffs after being called back to Hallownest by either The Radiance or The Hollow Knight. It is unknown how they managed to escape from the Abyss.</p>
			
			<p>Hornet notes in the City of Tears that the Knightâ€™s resilience is born from two voids; one being the Void that the Knight has within them, and the other void being the area outside of Hallownest. This area is referred to as a void in a lore tablet found in the Howling Cliffs. Spending time in this area caused the Knight to lose their memories, as is suggested by the description of the achievement Void.</p>
			
			<p>Once the Knight obtains Void Heart after remembering their past, they are able to unify the Void under their will. It is stated by Hornet that they acquired this ability by accepting the Void inside themselves. The creature in the area where the Shade Cloak is found has Dream Nail dialogue presumably referring to the Knight as the Lord of Shades after they gained Void Heart.</p>
			
			<p>At the beginning of the game, the Knight is equipped with only their Old Nail and the ability to heal themselves using SOUL. Throughout the game, the Knight gains access to new powers and items to help them through their journey.</p>

				<p>Health</p>

			<p>Health is represented as masks, shown in the upper-left corner of the screen. The Knight starts the game with 5 masks, and can obtain more by collecting Mask Shards. 4 Mask Shards make one new mask of health, up to a max of 9 total masks of health. Health is lost by taking damage, either from Enemies or from environmental hazards. Health can be regained by resting at a Bench or using Focus.</p>
			
			<p>Lifeblood masks, granted by Lifeseeds and certain Charms, are temporary masks that cannot be healed using Focus. Lifeblood masks will disappear upon resting at a bench, whereas those granted by Charms will regenerate.</p>

			</div>
			<p>SOUL is represented as a circular mask to the left of the health indicator. SOUL is used to cast Spells, as well as heal health using Focus. Striking enemies with the Nail is the primary source of regaining SOUL, though other tools and objects also grant SOUL. Collecting three vessel fragments increases the maximum soul by 33% .</p>
